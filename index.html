      <h1>About FormMeta</h1>
      <p>
        FormMeta is an open-source project that allows you to convert your Google Forms into custom UIs. With FormMeta, you can make your forms look more professional, brand them with your own colors and logos, and even add custom CSS and JavaScript to further customize their appearance and behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        FormMeta is built on top of the Google Forms platform and uses Google Sheets as its database, so you can still access and manage your form submissions as you normally would.
      </p>
      <p>
        FormMeta is developed by a small team of passionate developers who believe in the power of open-source software to make the world a better place. We hope that FormMeta will help you and your organization create more beautiful and effective forms, and we welcome your feedback and contributions to help us improve and evolve this project.
